## Estimate Gender Difference in Mean Finishing Time for 5K Road Races

The main objective of today's lab is to use a dataset gleaned from publicly-available data to give an estimate with a confidence interval obtained via bootstrapping.
The data come from race results that can be scraped from the website of the Nittany Valley Running Club at [https://www.nvrun.com/](https://www.nvrun.com/).

**Objective**:Â  Load the dataset represented by the `FiveKResults.csv` file as a `Table` object and implement bootstrapping to obtain a confidence interval for the
population parameter mu<sub>F</sub> - mu<sub>M</sub>, the difference between mean 5 kilometer road race finishing time for females and mean finishing time for males.
(NB:  In the original data, each runner identified as either F for female or M for male at the time of race registration.)

**Your assignment** is as follows:
